Rock, Paper, Scissors is a project which is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The game can currently be only played in the console of the web page. The player is prompted to play 5 rounds of rock, paper and scissors against the computer. The computer generates one of the 3 options at random during each round.

Each round alerts whether the player won, lost or drew with the computer. After the 5 rounds, the end result is announced.
