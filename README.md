Rock, Paper, Scissors is a project which is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The player will play 5 rounds of rock, paper and scissors against the computer by clicking on one of the images representing the choices. The computer generates one of the 3 options at random during each round.

Each round alerts whether the player won, lost or drew with the computer. If the player wins a round, then their score will increase by 1, the same goes for the computer. After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score is announced the winner.

The player can always restart a match by clicking on the restart button.
